## üöÄ **Smart Serve System**

The `make serve` command provides seamless port management with automatic conflict resolution and process tracking.

### **How Smart Serve Works**

1. **Port 4000 Priority**: Always tries port 4000 first for consistency
2. **Automatic Port Discovery**: Falls back to 4001 ‚Üí 4002... if port 4000 is busy
3. **PID Tracking**: Saves process ID to `service.pid` for easy management
4. **Seamless Experience**: No manual port selection needed
5. **Smart Fallback**: Automatically handles port conflicts

### **Port Priority System**

The system automatically tries ports in this order:
- **4000** (preferred development port)
- **4001-4010** (close range for development)
- **5000-5004** (alternative range)
- **8000-8004** (common dev server range)

### **PID Management**

- **Automatic PID capture** when starting server
- **PID file**: `service.pid` (configurable)
- **Easy process management** with `make stop`
- **Clean shutdown** without orphaned processes

## üëÄ **Smart File Watching System**

The `make serve-with-watch` command provides seamless auto-reload functionality by monitoring file changes and automatically restarting the server.

### **How Smart File Watching Works**

1. **Background Operation**: File watcher runs in background, terminal remains fully usable
2. **File Change Detection**: Monitors `.md`, `.yml`, `.css`, and `.scss` files in `docs/`
3. **Automatic Restart**: Server restarts automatically when changes are detected
4. **Separate Logging**: File watcher logs go to `file-watcher.log`, server logs to `service.log`
5. **Smart Exclusions**: Ignores build artifacts (`_site/`, `.jekyll-cache/`) to prevent false triggers

### **Monitored File Types**

- **Content**: `.md` (Markdown), `.yml` (YAML data)
- **Styling**: `.css`, `.scss` (CSS and Sass)
- **Excluded**: `_site/`, `.jekyll-cache/` (build artifacts)

## üìù **Log Management System**

The development server redirects all logs to `service.log` for a cleaner terminal experience and persistent logging.

### **Log Features**

- **Clean terminal**: No more verbose container logs when starting server
- **Persistent logs**: All logs saved to `service.log` for debugging
- **Easy access**: Simple commands to view and manage logs
- **Automatic cleanup**: Log file included in `make clean` operations

### **Log File Location**

- **Default**: `service.log` in project root
- **Configurable**: `LOG_FILE=custom.log make serve`
- **Auto-cleanup**: Removed with `make clean` and `make force-clean`

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Environment Configuration**

### **Port Configuration**
```bash
# Default port (exclusive)
PORT=4000              # Main site - single port approach

# Use alternative ports if needed
PORT=4100 make serve   # Site on port 4100
PORT=5000 make serve   # Site on port 5000
```

### **Single Port Benefits**
- **Simplified configuration**: Only one port to manage
- **No conflicts**: Eliminated LiveReload port issues
- **More reliable**: Fewer points of failure
- **Easier debugging**: Single port to check
- **Better compatibility**: Works in all environments

### **Directory Configuration**
```bash
# Source and output directories
DOCS_DIR=docs          # Source Markdown files
SITE_DIR=docs/_site    # Built static site
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml  # Container configuration
```

### **Build Environment**
```bash
# Jekyll environment
JEKYLL_ENV=development  # Development mode (default)
JEKYLL_ENV=production   # Production mode (optimized)
```

## ‚ö° **Makefile Optimizations**

The Makefile has been optimized for efficiency and maintainability:

### **Consolidated Functions**
- **Log Management**: Unified `show-logs`, `show-logs-tail`, and `clear-logs` functions
- **Cleanup Operations**: Consolidated `cleanup-artifacts` and `kill-processes-on-ports` helpers
- **Port Management**: Streamlined port checking and conflict resolution

### **Reduced Redundancy**
- **Eliminated duplicate code** in log commands
- **Consolidated cleanup logic** between `clean` and `force-clean`
- **Streamlined serve function chains** for better performance

### **Improved Maintainability**
- **Helper functions** for common operations
- **Consistent error handling** across all commands
- **Modular design** for easier future enhancements

## üîÑ **Auto-Refresh Features**

The development server includes automatic browser refresh:
- **File watching**: Monitors all files in `docs/`
- **Instant updates**: Browser refreshes when you save changes
- **Smart detection**: Works with Markdown, YAML, CSS, and other files
- **Single port**: Uses only port 4000 for simplicity and reliability
- **No port conflicts**: Eliminated LiveReload port management issues

## üìù **Log Files & Monitoring**

The development environment creates several log files for monitoring:

- **`service.log`** - Server activity and Jekyll output
- **`file-watcher.log`** - File watching activity and auto-reload events
- **`service.pid`** - Process ID tracking for server management
- **`.last-check`** - File modification timestamp tracking

### **Monitoring Commands**
```bash
# Server activity
make logs                # Live server logs
make logs-show           # Recent server activity

# File watching activity
make watch-logs          # Live file watcher logs
make watch-logs-show     # Recent file watcher activity

# Overall status
make status              # Server and process status
```
