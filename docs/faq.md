## Project Overview

<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 What is this project about?</strong></summary>

This capstone project focuses on optimizing workforce management for Intuit's Virtual Expert Platform (VEP). You'll develop demand forecasting models to predict customer interaction volumes and supply optimization models to determine optimal staffing levels. The goal is to balance service quality with operational costs while meeting business constraints.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🏢 What makes this project different from a typical academic project?</strong></summary>

This is an <strong>industry partnership</strong> with Intuit, not a traditional academic course. You'll work with real business constraints, industry mentors, and actual workforce management challenges. The focus is on learning, professional development, and real-world application rather than traditional grading.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📚 What will I learn from this project?</strong></summary>

By the end, you'll understand forecasting and supply optimization fundamentals, recognize key trade-offs in workforce planning, interpret data to guide decision-making, and apply optimization logic to create adaptive staffing plans. You'll also gain experience working with industry partners and developing production-ready solutions.

</details>
