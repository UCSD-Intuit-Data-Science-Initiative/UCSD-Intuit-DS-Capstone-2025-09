## Project Overview

### **🎯 What is this project about?**
This capstone project focuses on optimizing workforce management for Intuit's Virtual Expert Platform (VEP). You'll develop demand forecasting models to predict customer interaction volumes and supply optimization models to determine optimal staffing levels. The goal is to balance service quality with operational costs while meeting business constraints.

### **🏢 What makes this project different from a typical academic project?**
This is an **industry partnership** with Intuit, not a traditional academic course. You'll work with real business constraints, industry mentors, and actual workforce management challenges. The focus is on learning, professional development, and real-world application rather than traditional grading.

### **📚 What will I learn from this project?**
By the end, you'll understand forecasting and supply optimization fundamentals, recognize key trade-offs in workforce planning, interpret data to guide decision-making, and apply optimization logic to create adaptive staffing plans. You'll also gain experience working with industry partners and developing production-ready solutions.

## Timeline & Schedule

### **⏰ How long is the project?**
The project spans two quarters (6+ months):
- **Quarter 1 (Fall 2025)**: October 1, 2025 - January 20, 2026 (with holiday break Dec 16 - Jan 5)
- **Quarter 2 (Winter 2026)**: January 20, 2026 - April 21, 2026

### **🎄 What happens during the holiday break?**
The holiday break (Dec 16, 2025 - Jan 5, 2026) is a **complete break** with no work expectations. This allows the team to rest and recharge before the intensive Q2 optimization phase.

### **📅 What are the key milestones?**
- **Dec 10, 2025**: Q1 Progress Review (demand forecasting)
- **Jan 20, 2026**: Q1 Final Deliverables
- **Mar 17, 2026**: Q2 Progress Review (integrated system)
- **Apr 21, 2026**: Final Presentation

## Technical Requirements

### **🐍 What programming language should I use?**
**Python 3.9+** is required. The project uses Python for all data science, machine learning, and optimization work.

### **📦 What libraries and tools will I need?**
Essential libraries include:
- **Data Science**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- **Time Series**: sktime, Prophet, darts, autogluon
- **Optimization**: PuLP, OR-Tools, scipy.optimize
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

### **⚙️ How do I set up my development environment?**
We recommend using **Poetry** for dependency management, though virtual environments are also supported. See the [Technology & Environment](resources/technology) section for detailed setup instructions.

### **☁️ Do I need cloud computing resources?**
For development, local machines with 8GB+ RAM are sufficient. For production deployment, we'll use AWS/GCP resources provided by Intuit.

## Data & Datasets

### **📊 What data will I be working with?**
You'll work with workforce management data including:
- **Demand Data**: Call/chat volumes, interaction types, complexity scores
- **Staff Data**: Agent performance, skill sets, availability
- **Operational Data**: Service levels, handling times, utilization rates
- **External Data**: Tax deadlines, marketing campaigns, seasonal events

### **🔐 How do I access the datasets?**
Specific dataset access details will be provided during the project kickoff. Data will be available through secure Intuit channels.

### **✅ Is the data real or synthetic?**
You'll work with **real, anonymized** open-source operations data, providing authentic workforce management challenges and constraints.

## Workforce Management Domain

### **🏢 What is workforce management?**
Workforce management (WFM) involves optimizing staffing levels to meet customer demand while managing costs and service quality. It includes demand forecasting, staff scheduling, and real-time adjustments.

### **⚠️ Why is this challenging?**
Key challenges include:
- **Fluctuating demand** with seasonal and unexpected patterns
- **Complex constraints** (labor laws, skill requirements, budget limits)
- **Many-to-many mapping** between staff skills and demand types
- **Real-time adjustments** needed when forecasts change

### **📈 What are the key metrics I should understand?**
- **Service Level**: Percentage of interactions answered within target time
- **ASA**: Average Speed of Answer (wait time)
- **AHT**: Average Handling Time (interaction duration)
- **Utilization Rate**: Staff efficiency metrics
