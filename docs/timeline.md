A clear schedule of all major project milestones and deadlines for the two-quarter capstone project. This timeline reflects an industry partnership model where Intuit serves as an advisory partner, providing guidance, feedback, and real-world context rather than formal academic grading.

## ðŸŽ¯ Milestones

### Single Quarter (Fall 2025): Part 1 then Part 2

See [Project Overview](project-overview.md) for expectations and detailed tasks for Part 1 (Demand Forecasting) and Part 2 (Supply Optimization).

## ðŸ’¬ Example Office Hours Topics & Discussion Points

- Validate problem framing, success metrics, and scope
- Review data assumptions, feature engineering plan, and evaluation setup
- Walk through baseline model results and error analysis
- Discuss optimization formulation: decision variables, constraints, objective
- Outline integration plan and key risks; ask for guidance on trade-offs
- Confirm next steps, timeline, and expectations through final
- Discuss limitations, decisions made, and recommended future work
- Q&A and feedback
