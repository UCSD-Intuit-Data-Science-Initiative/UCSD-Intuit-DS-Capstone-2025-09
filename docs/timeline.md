## Risk Mitigation & Contingency Planning

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Data Quality Issues**: Allocate extra time in Q1 for data cleaning and validation
2. **Model Performance**: Plan for multiple model iterations and fallback approaches
3. **Integration Complexity**: Start integration testing early in Q2
4. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Schedule regular check-ins and feedback sessions with industry advisors
5. **Holiday Break Impact**: Ensure Q1 deliverables are complete before Dec 16 break
6. **Post-Holiday Re-engagement**: Plan for team re-engagement and context recovery

### Buffer Time
- **Q1**: 1 week buffer before progress review presentation + 1 week before holiday break
- **Q2**: 1 week buffer before final presentation
- **Holiday Break**: 3-week break (Dec 16 - Jan 5) with no work expectations
- **Overall**: 2 weeks of contingency time distributed across phases
